# Third Demo

I demoed the app to the pastor and a few church members after enhancing the light mode to make it more "textured" and with effects like a shadow on the left (to mimic the "spine" of the Bible) and a red gradient on the right (to mimic how the colored edges of Bible pages look when stacked). They loved it! These simple, subtle changes give just a hint of realism to the experience while avoiding distractions.

We're almost to the point where we could use this in a Sunday service! I think the last major piece to solve is integration with the rest of the sermon outline. Sermon outlines consist of more than just Scripture, and I do like to use more bespoke backgrounds and screen elements to drive key points home. I'd like to retain this, but I also want to avoid having to switch back and forth between PowerPoint and this app during service. I know that we could use something like OBS' "projector" output to control which app is emitted to our live projectors, but I'd prefer to switch into this new app when the sermon starts and just stay there. Here's one easy solution: give the user the ability to add image files to the "passages" array, not just verses. To keep things simple, we could start with a requirement that these images just live within the same folder as the "passages" JSON files.
