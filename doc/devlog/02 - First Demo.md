## First Demo

I demoed the app to the pastor after completing the first dev session. He liked the direction and the interactivity, and only had one major area of feedback: he suggested that we add a light mode theme that makes it more closely mimic the visual style of a page out of the Bible. I have a few ideas as to what "make it look more like a page from the Bible" might entail:

- Use a light background with dark text, instead of light text on a dark background.
- Create a visible contrast between `#verses-container` and the page background, so it looks like an actual page.
- Add verse number superscripts.
- Add line breaks between paragraphs.
- Display "words of Christ" in red.

Some of these will be more complex to implement than others, but it's probably worth focusing our second dev session on a "light mode".
