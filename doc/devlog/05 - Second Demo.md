# Second Demo

I demoed the app to the pastor after adding the "light mode" and persistence. He was generally pleased with the direction of the app, but suggested that we try to add a bit more "texture" to the light mode--something subtle to more closely resemble a page. Not quite all the way to parchment, but something that feels a little more tangible than black on white. For reference, we looked together at a photo online of an open Bible, and I saved it here as "bible.jpg".

I think the app is coming along well; I'd like to focus v0.4 on getting the style just right.
